# Micro Minecraft 3D Rendering Project

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of the Micro Minecraft project, including the SystemVerilog code for 3D rendering and other functionalities. The project also includes C code for keyboard interaction and Python scripts for converting Minecraft 2D texture images to ROM format used in our project. 
You can find a more detailed introduction to this project on Bilibili: [Micro Minecraft Project Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1PYhPedESV/)

## Contents

- **SystemVerilog Code**: All Verilog files necessary for 3D rendering and other functionalities of the Micro Minecraft project.
- **C Code for Keyboard Interaction**: Located in the `software` folder, this contains the C code used for handling keyboard inputs.
- **Python Project Files**: Found in the `FinalProjectPythonTools` folder, these Python scripts convert 2D Minecraft texture images (PNG format) to ROM format for use in the project.

## Not Included

To minimize the risk of direct copying for final projects, the following items are not provided:

- **FPGA Configuration Files**: The configuration files for the DE2-115 FPGA board (EP4CE115F29C7) are not included.
- **Quartus Compilation Folders**: Any folders generated during the Quartus compilation process are excluded.
- **Eclipse Workspace Folder**: The workspace folder for the Eclipse platform is not provided.

## Requirements

- **FPGA Board**: DE2-115 FPGA board (EP4CE115F29C7) or a compatible FPGA board.
- **Quartus Software**: For compiling and uploading the Verilog code.
- **Eclipse IDE**: For compiling and uploading the C code for keyboard interaction.
- **Python**: For running the conversion scripts.

## Inspiration and Academic Integrity

This project aims to inspire those who wish to implement 3D rendering in their coursework, such as in ECE385 and similar courses. However, we strongly oppose any actions that violate academic integrity. Please use this project as a learning tool and a source of inspiration, but ensure that all submitted work is your own and adheres to your institution's academic policies.

## A Note on Code Quality

Due to the tight schedule at the end of the semester, the code may be somewhat disorganized. We appreciate your understanding and patience. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarifications.
